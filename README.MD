# sql-lint

`sql-lint` will do sanity checks on your queries as well as bring errors back from the DB.
If you worry about forgetting `WHERE`s on a `DELETE` or borking your data with unexpected characters, then `sql-lint` is for you.

[Read the documentation for a complete walkthrough](https://sql-lint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/files/introduction.html)

## Installation

```
npm i -g sql-lint
# or
yarn global add sql-lint
```

Or download a [binary](https://github.com/joereynolds/sql-lint/releases)

## Usage

`sql-lint` works on files, directories and stdin.

```
# Will lint all .sql files recursively from the current directory
sql-lint .

# Lints the create-person.sql file
sql-lint create-person.sql

# Lints stdin
echo 'DELETE FROM person;' | sql-lint
```

## Programmatically

`sql-lint` can also be used within your js/ts files (though admittedly it's stronger as a cli command).

```
npm i sql-lint
# or
yarn add sql-lint
```

```
import sqlLint from 'sql-lint'

// using async/await

const errors = await sqlLint({
  sql: 'SELECT my_column FROM my_table',
})

// or using promise

sqlLint({ sql: 'SELECT my_column FROM my_table' }).then(errors => {
  for (const error of errors) {
    // do something
  }
})
```

### Parameters

sql-lint accepts an object using the following interface as its only argument

```
{
  sql: string
  host?: string
  user?: string
  port?: number
  driver?: string
  prefix?: string
  password?: string
  database?: string
  verbosity?: number
}
```

### Notes on some of the parameters

`sql`: can have multiple queries separated by `;`

`host`: if host is not provided `sql-lint` will only perform checks that do not require a connection

`driver`: defaults to mysql

`port`: if port is not provided it will use the default port for the driver you are using

### Output

sql-lint returns an `array` of objects with the following shape

```
{
  line: number
  error: string
  source: string
  additionalInformation: string
}
```

## Editor Integration

If your editor supports external tools, then it supports `sql-lint`.
Below is the list that have direct support for `sql-lint` either through plugins or configuration.

| Editor  | Plugin                                                                                            |

## Checks

A quick rundown of the checks is below but you should [read the documentation](https://sql-lint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/files/checks.html)
for an exhaustive list.

`sql-lint` comes with its own suite of checks. It
also returns any errors from the SQL server you have connected to. Generally
you'll find that the errors from `sql-lint` are more informative than those from
the server. That said, you will still want errors from the server as it covers
more cases and will catch things that `sql-lint` does not.

<details>
  <summary>unmatched-parentheses</summary>

Shown when a query has an unbalanced amount of parentheses.

```
test/test-files//test.sql:16 [sql-lint: unmatched-parentheses] Unmatched parentheses.

Shown when a `DELETE` statement is missing a `WHERE` clause.

```
test/test-files/test.sql:20 [sql-lint: missing-where] DELETE statement missing WHERE clause.
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>invalid-drop-option</summary>

Shown when an invalid option is given to the `DROP` statement.

```
test/test-files/test.sql:22 [sql-lint: invalid-drop-option] Option 'thing' is not a valid option, must be one of '["database","event","function","index","logfile","procedure","schema","server","table","view","tablespace","trigger"]'.
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>invalid-create-option</summary>

Shown when an invalid option is given to the `CREATE` statement.

```
:24 [sql-lint: invalid-create-option] Option 'test' is not a valid option, must be one of '["algorithm","database","definer","event","function","index","or","procedure","server","table","tablespace","temporary","trigger","user","unique","view"]'.

</details>

<details>

  <summary>odd-code-point</summary>

\*<small>This check came about whilst working Microsoft Excel. Microsoft likes to
add a lot of zany characters which can subtly break your data without you
realising.</small>

```
